    <h4 class="subheader">...and why should have I gone with Akenova?</h4>
    <p>At Akenova, we were driven to succeed by turning our clients into
    success stories. We believed in strategically partnering with our
    clients to develop custom solutions for each one of them. We also
    provided clients with strategic assistance in the areas of funding
    and business development. In some instances, if we saw potential
    in a start-up client we were willing to defer Akenova’s setup costs
    up to 12 months from launch.</p>

      <p>The dot Marketing Suite (dMS) package is for the forward
        thinking business owner who is serious about the internet as an
        area of growth. The dMS package leverages Akenova’s consulting
        experience in the area of online marketing. The dMS package
        harnesses the power of various online marketing programs to grow
        the client’s business online:</p>
      <h5 class="subheader">Email Marketing</h5>
      <p>Email Marketing has proven itself to be one of the most
        efficient online marketing channels. Akenova facilitates the
        entire email marketing process right from collection of email
        addresses on the store front to deployment, tracking, and
        analysis of email campaign performance.</p>
      <h5 class="subheader">Search Engine Marketing(SEM)</h5>
      <p>As part of the dMS package, Akenova typically focuses on the
        three Tier 1 (Google, Yahoo, MSN) engines for its PPC
        programs. However, depending on client budgets & preferences
        they may choose to focus on a single engine or combination
        thereof.</p>
      <h5 class="subheader">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h5>
      <p>Akenova strategically implements SEO best practices for its
        clients as part of the SEO package. Additionally it keeps its
        clients updated on the latest SEO techniques ranging from
        backlinking to integration of User Generated Content (UGC)</p>
      <h5 class="subheader">Affiliate Marketing</h5>
      <p>Affiliate marketing has been around for a while and now has
        proven to be a high-growth channel for online marketers. A
        strong, well-incentivized affiliate program can grow sales
        exponentially in a relatively short period of time. Akenova
        focuses on optimizing the efficiency of this channel from day
        one by monitoring the extent and depth of marketing offers
        extended to affiliate partners.</p>
      <h5 class="subheader">Shopping Malls</h5>
      <p>Akenova recognizes the importance of the presence of a
        consumer brand on high-traffic shopping mall sites such as
        Amazon and Ebay. To facilitate this initiative, Akenova offers
        pre-built integrations (through APIs) with the most popular
        malls.</p>
      <h5 class="subheader">Comparison Shopping Engines</h5>
      <p>Shopping engines remain a key component of the marketing mix
        for brands that seek to maximize their exposure. Akenova uses a
        combination of paid and free shopping engines to gain exposure
        for their client’s brands at the lowest possible costs.</p>

    <h4 class="subheader">eCommerce</h4>
    <img src="images/ecommerce.png"/>
    <p>The dotArchitect (DA) platform offered by Akenova is built off
    Magento’s popular open-source e-commerce application. This means
    that in addition to Akenova’s efforts to improve the platform, a
    community of developers around the world are also committed to
    enhancing its features. The DA platform is feature rich and offers
    a high degree of flexibility allowing users to completely
    customize their sites.
    <p>Akenova works to develop a completely customized store front
    for clients. Alternatively, we offer client’s a selection of
    pre-existing templates to choose from, if they would like to be up
    and running in the shortest possible time frame; typically a week
    from the kick-off meeting.</p>
    <p>Some of the many functionalities that can be expected from the
    DA platform include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fully automated product catalog management</li>
      <li>Dynamic generation of informational pages using the
      integrated CMS</li>
      <li>One page checkout with SSL support *</li>
      <li>Cross-selling capabilities on product details pages</li>
      <li>Promotional management by customer groups/ products</li>
      <li>Customer/Prospect database auto generation</li>
      <li>Transactional email support</li>
      <li>URL rewrites supported</li>
      <li>3rd party integration through custom APIs</li>
      <li>Integration with Google Analytics</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="subheader">Content Management</h4>
    <p>The Fastedious CMS is designed for small and medium
    (non-ecommerce) businesses who have until now maintained a static
    HTML website for their business and require the maintenance/update
    process to be quick and efficient. Powered by a popular
    open-source platform, Fastedious is able to transform a static
    website into a highly efficient, automated website in as little as
    one week. Some of the advantages of using an automated CMS instead
    of a static site include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Database driven content (text, photos, music, video and more)</li>
      <li>On-the-fly web page creation</li>
      <li>Dynamic site navigation</li>
      <li>Use of templates for different pages</li>
      <li>Shopping cart integration</li>
      <li>No technical expertise required for content management</li>
    </ul>
