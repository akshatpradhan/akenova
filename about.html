      <h4 class="subheader">who we were</h4>
      <p>Akenova was founded by a group of professionals with diverse
        backgrounds and a broad range of expertise ranging from
        digital marketing to internet security. The team at Akenova was
        constantly working to push the envelope with e-commerce and
        business automation. Akenova realized that every small
        business owner has “big” dreams and therefore was keen on
        turning those dreams into a reality.</p>
      <p>For most e-commerce solutions companies, clients are a hood
        ornament that they can add to their portfolio. For Akenova, a
        client was more than just a showcase. We worked with our clients
        to understand their business thoroughly and partner with them
        to grow their business exponentially through automation and
        strategic consultation.</p>
      <p>Akenova was focused on working with start-ups in need of
        technical and strategic assistance. The uniqueness of
        Akenova’s offerings lie in its ability to not only consult but
        also implement its strategic recommendations in partnership
        with clients.
